I'm a data science all-rounder! My current work at UC Irvine centers around biostatistics, experimental design, public health, database management, data engineering, data privacy, and clinical & translational science. My previous industry experience with data science encompasses predictive modeling, business analytics, big data analysis on cloud platforms, process improvement and automation, natural language processing, and computer vision.

I'm here to help others make **strategic decisions** or **exciting claims,** [**with confidence.**]{.underline}

## Biostatistics, Data Science & Data Engineering

I got into data science as a natural extension of business analysis and process improvement work, simply by virtue of employing the econometrics I learned in undergrad to the problems my teams and firms were facing. After building my acumen in the training and organizational development consulting space, I pivoted and created machine learning tools for prediction and text analysis with [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/), [spaCy](https://spacy.io/), and [SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/).

Presently, you can find me on the tail end of another pivot, this time into research and biostatistics. As a statistical consultant at UC Irvine, I'm collaborating with other statisticians, MDs, biologists, epidemiologists, geneticists, public health experts, and clinical practitioners. I bounce back and forth between wrestling with clever imputation for low sample/high missingness clinical trials and forcefully folding immense cohorts drawn from EHR databases into secure storage with [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/), and everywhere in between.

My daily driver toolset includes [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/), [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) \[for Python & Jupyter\], [SAS](https://www.sas.com/en_us/software/stat.html), [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), [tidymodels](https://www.tidymodels.org/packages), [STAN](https://mc-stan.org/), [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/), and [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/).

## Statistics + Data Science Communities

I am incredibly grateful to have a number of safe havens I can visit to learn, share, and meet fellow researchers and professionals in this field. Among those, especially if you're also in SoCal, I'd credit and invite you to:

-   [SoCal R Users Group](https://www.meetup.com/socal-rug/ "SoCal RUG meets on a monthly basis for online and in-person events")
-   [Orange County/Long Beach Chapter of the ASA](https://community.amstat.org/oclb/home "Official ASA cluster for the area, full of sharp and clever folks from Long Beach to Irvine to Fullerton!")
-   [CABERD Consortium](https://med.stanford.edu/spectrum/ctsa-cores-and-programs/research-methods-core/berd/caberd-consortium.html)
